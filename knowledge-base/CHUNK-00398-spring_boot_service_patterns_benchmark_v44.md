# Spring Boot Service Patterns — Benchmark (v44)

## Suite

Under high load, **Suite** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 44 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

Under high load, **Methodology** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 44 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

Under high load, **Dataset** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 44 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Spring Boot Service Patterns benchmark variant 44.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.80 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 780 |
| error rate | 0.0450 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```java
public class JavaSpring {
    private final String topic = "java_spring";
    private final int variant = 44;

    public Record<String, Object> process(Map<String, Object> payload) {
        return Map.of("status", "ok", "topic", topic, "variant", variant);
    }
}
```
