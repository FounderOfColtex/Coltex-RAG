# Graph Traversal for Dependency Analysis — Guide (v1)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Graph Traversal for Dependency Analysis` (guide). This variant 1 covers bfs, dfs, pagerank, communities at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
