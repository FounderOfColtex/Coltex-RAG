# Redis Caching Patterns — Api Reference (v111)

## Endpoint

When integrating with legacy systems, **Endpoint** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 111 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When integrating with legacy systems, **Authentication** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 111 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When integrating with legacy systems, **Request Schema** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 111 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

When integrating with legacy systems, **Response Schema** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 111 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

When integrating with legacy systems, **Error Codes** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 111 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
TOPIC="redis_caching"
VARIANT=111
kubectl rollout status deployment/redis-svc
```
