# Azure Functions Architecture — Api Reference (v147)

## Endpoint

From first principles, **Endpoint** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

From first principles, **Authentication** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

From first principles, **Request Schema** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

From first principles, **Response Schema** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

From first principles, **Error Codes** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface AzureFunctionsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleAzureFunctions(config: AzureFunctionsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
