# Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services — Api Reference (v129)

## Endpoint

For production systems, **Endpoint** for `Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services` (api_reference). This variant 129 covers hpa, autoscaling, gpu, serving at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

For production systems, **Authentication** for `Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services` (api_reference). This variant 129 covers hpa, autoscaling, gpu, serving at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
