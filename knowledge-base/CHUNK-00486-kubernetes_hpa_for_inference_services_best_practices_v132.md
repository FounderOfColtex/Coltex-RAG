# Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services — Best Practices (v132)

## Principles

Under high load, **Principles** for `Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services` (best_practices). This variant 132 covers hpa, autoscaling, gpu, serving at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
