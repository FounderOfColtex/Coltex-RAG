# PostgreSQL Index Strategies — Api Reference (v93)

## Endpoint

During incident response, **Endpoint** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 93 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

During incident response, **Authentication** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 93 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

During incident response, **Request Schema** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 93 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

During incident response, **Response Schema** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 93 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

During incident response, **Error Codes** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 93 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS postgresql_93 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 93,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_postgresql_93_topic ON postgresql_93 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM postgresql_93
WHERE topic = 'postgres_indexing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
