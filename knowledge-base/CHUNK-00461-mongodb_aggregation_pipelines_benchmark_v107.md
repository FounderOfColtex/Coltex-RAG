# MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines — Benchmark (v107)

## Suite

From first principles, **Suite** for `MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 107 covers aggregation, sharding, indexes, schema_design at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

From first principles, **Methodology** for `MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 107 covers aggregation, sharding, indexes, schema_design at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

From first principles, **Dataset** for `MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 107 covers aggregation, sharding, indexes, schema_design at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines benchmark variant 107.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.86 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 1725 |
| error rate | 0.1080 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
