# Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems — Guide (v10)

## Overview

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Overview** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (guide). This variant 10 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
