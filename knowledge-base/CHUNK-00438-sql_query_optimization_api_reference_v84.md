# SQL Query Optimization — Api Reference (v84)

## Endpoint

Under high load, **Endpoint** for `SQL Query Optimization` (api_reference). This variant 84 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

Under high load, **Authentication** for `SQL Query Optimization` (api_reference). This variant 84 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

Under high load, **Request Schema** for `SQL Query Optimization` (api_reference). This variant 84 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

Under high load, **Response Schema** for `SQL Query Optimization` (api_reference). This variant 84 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

Under high load, **Error Codes** for `SQL Query Optimization` (api_reference). This variant 84 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sql_84 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 84,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sql_84_topic ON sql_84 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM sql_84
WHERE topic = 'sql_optimization' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
