# SQL Query Optimization — Code Walkthrough (v88)

## Problem

In practice, **Problem** for `SQL Query Optimization` (code_walkthrough). This variant 88 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sql_88 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 88,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sql_88_topic ON sql_88 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM sql_88
WHERE topic = 'sql_optimization' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
