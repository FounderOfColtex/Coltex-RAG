# Redis Caching Patterns — Guide (v109)

## Overview

During incident response, **Overview** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (guide). This variant 109 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

During incident response, **Prerequisites** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (guide). This variant 109 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Core Concepts

## Implementation Steps

During incident response, **Implementation Steps** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (guide). This variant 109 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Validation

During incident response, **Validation** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (guide). This variant 109 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Next Steps

During incident response, **Next Steps** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (guide). This variant 109 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
TOPIC="redis_caching"
VARIANT=109
kubectl rollout status deployment/redis-svc
```
