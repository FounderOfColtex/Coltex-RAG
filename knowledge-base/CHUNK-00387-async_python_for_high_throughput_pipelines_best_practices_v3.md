# Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines — Best Practices (v33)

## Principles

For production systems, **Principles** for `Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 33 covers asyncio, aiohttp, concurrency, queues at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

For production systems, **Do** for `Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 33 covers asyncio, aiohttp, concurrency, queues at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

For production systems, **Don't** for `Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 33 covers asyncio, aiohttp, concurrency, queues at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class AsyncPython:
    """Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "async_python", "variant": 33}
```
