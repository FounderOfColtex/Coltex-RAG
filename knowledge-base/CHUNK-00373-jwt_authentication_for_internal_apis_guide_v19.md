# JWT Authentication for Internal APIs — Guide (v19)

## Overview

From first principles, **Overview** for `JWT Authentication for Internal APIs` (guide). This variant 19 covers jwt, oauth, rbac, tokens at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface JwtAuthConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleJwtAuth(config: JwtAuthConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
