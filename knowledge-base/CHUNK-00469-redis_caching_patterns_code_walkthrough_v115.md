# Redis Caching Patterns — Code Walkthrough (v115)

## Problem

From first principles, **Problem** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (code_walkthrough). This variant 115 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
TOPIC="redis_caching"
VARIANT=115
kubectl rollout status deployment/redis-svc
```
