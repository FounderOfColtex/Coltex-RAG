# Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems — Api Reference (v12)

## Endpoint

Under high load, **Endpoint** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (api_reference). This variant 12 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

Under high load, **Authentication** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (api_reference). This variant 12 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

Under high load, **Request Schema** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (api_reference). This variant 12 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

Under high load, **Response Schema** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (api_reference). This variant 12 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

Under high load, **Error Codes** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (api_reference). This variant 12 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface AgentMemoryConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleAgentMemory(config: AgentMemoryConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
