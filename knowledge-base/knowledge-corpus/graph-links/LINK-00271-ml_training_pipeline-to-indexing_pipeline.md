# Graph Link: ml_training_pipeline → indexing_pipeline

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex knowledge graph.

## Connection type
**depends_on** — documents in `ml_training_pipeline` depends on `indexing_pipeline`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `ml_training_pipeline`
- Anchor: `HUB-ML_TRAINING_PIPELINE`

## Target hub
- Hub: `indexing_pipeline`
- Anchor: `HUB-INDEXING_PIPELINE`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this graph link for multi-hop context.

## Coltex note
Graph links are first-class edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
