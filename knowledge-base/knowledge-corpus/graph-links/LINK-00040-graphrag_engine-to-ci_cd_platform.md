# Graph Link: graphrag_engine → ci_cd_platform

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex knowledge graph.

## Connection type
**calls** — documents in `graphrag_engine` calls into `ci_cd_platform`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `graphrag_engine`
- Anchor: `HUB-GRAPHRAG_ENGINE`

## Target hub
- Hub: `ci_cd_platform`
- Anchor: `HUB-CI_CD_PLATFORM`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this graph link for multi-hop context.

## Coltex note
Graph links are first-class edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
