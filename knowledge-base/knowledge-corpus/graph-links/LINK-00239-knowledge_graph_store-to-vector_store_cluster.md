# Graph Link: knowledge_graph_store → vector_store_cluster

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex knowledge graph.

## Connection type
**calls** — documents in `knowledge_graph_store` calls into `vector_store_cluster`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `knowledge_graph_store`
- Anchor: `HUB-KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_STORE`

## Target hub
- Hub: `vector_store_cluster`
- Anchor: `HUB-VECTOR_STORE_CLUSTER`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this graph link for multi-hop context.

## Coltex note
Graph links are first-class edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
