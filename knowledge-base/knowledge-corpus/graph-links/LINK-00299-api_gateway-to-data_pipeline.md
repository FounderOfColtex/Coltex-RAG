# Graph Link: api_gateway → data_pipeline

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex knowledge graph.

## Connection type
**documents** — documents in `api_gateway` documents `data_pipeline`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `api_gateway`
- Anchor: `HUB-API_GATEWAY`

## Target hub
- Hub: `data_pipeline`
- Anchor: `HUB-DATA_PIPELINE`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this graph link for multi-hop context.

## Coltex note
Graph links are first-class edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
