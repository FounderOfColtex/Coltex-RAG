# Advanced TypeScript Generics — Benchmark (v62)

## Suite

For security-sensitive deployments, **Suite** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (benchmark). This variant 62 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

For security-sensitive deployments, **Methodology** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (benchmark). This variant 62 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

For security-sensitive deployments, **Dataset** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (benchmark). This variant 62 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Advanced TypeScript Generics benchmark variant 62.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.76 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 1050 |
| error rate | 0.0630 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface TsGenericsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleTsGenerics(config: TsGenericsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
