# Rust Ownership in Systems Programming — Benchmark (v80)

## Suite

In practice, **Suite** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (benchmark). This variant 80 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

In practice, **Methodology** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (benchmark). This variant 80 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

In practice, **Dataset** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (benchmark). This variant 80 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Rust Ownership in Systems Programming benchmark variant 80.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.72 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 1320 |
| error rate | 0.0810 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```rust
pub struct RustOwnership {
    pub topic: String,
    pub variant: u32,
}

impl RustOwnership {
    pub fn process(&self) -> serde_json::Value {
        serde_json::json!({"status": "ok", "topic": self.topic, "variant": self.variant})
    }
}
```
