# Coltex Platform Roadmap

Enterprise features that extend Coltex Mega RAG from a commercial corpus into
full knowledge infrastructure.

Status key: **Available** · **In progress** · **Planned**

---

## 1. Coltex Console

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P0 · **Impact:** Primary differentiator

The flagship experience. Replace file editing with visual knowledge management.

### Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Knowledge Explorer** | Browse and filter the full document catalog |
| **Documents** | View, edit, tag, and classify content |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Interactive node-edge visualization |
| **Embeddings** | Inspect vector spaces and similarity clusters |
| **Search** | Hybrid semantic + keyword search with graph expansion |
| **Relationships** | Typed edges: depends_on, see_also, related, routes_to |
| **Metadata** | doc_type, hub, domain, tags, provenance |
| **Clusters** | Functional groupings and hub assignments |

### User story

> An engineer opens Coltex Console, searches "JWT authentication", clicks the Auth hub node, explores connected API and Database documents, and updates a runbook — without touching a markdown file on disk.

---

## 2. Automatic Connectors

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P0

Connector ecosystem so Coltex stays current automatically, without manual imports.

### First-party connectors

| Connector | Source types | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| GitHub | Repos, README, wiki, issues | Planned |
| GitLab | Repos, wiki, issues | Planned |
| Notion | Pages, databases | Planned |
| Confluence | Spaces, pages | Planned |
| Google Drive | Docs, Sheets, Slides | Planned |
| SharePoint | Sites, documents | Planned |
| Dropbox | Files | Planned |
| OneDrive | Files | Planned |
| Jira | Issues, epics, comments | Planned |
| Slack | Channels, threads | Planned |
| Discord | Channels, threads | Planned |

Manifest: [config/connectors.yaml](../../config/connectors.yaml)

---

## 3. Automatic Synchronization

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P0

No manual imports. Knowledge stays current automatically.

```
GitHub Repository
       │
       ▼  (webhook / poll)
Coltex detects commit
       │
       ▼
Ingest changed files
       │
       ├──► Update document catalog
       ├──► Rebuild affected graph edges
       └──► Re-embed changed chunks
```

Supports webhook triggers, scheduled polling, and incremental diff-based updates.

---

## 4. Knowledge Timeline

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P1

Every document carries version history — critical for enterprise audit and rollback.

```
Version 1  →  Version 2  →  Version 3  →  Rollback
   │              │              │
 created       edited         synced
```

- Immutable version snapshots per document
- Diff view between versions
- One-click rollback to any prior version
- Sync events linked to connector source (e.g., commit SHA)

---

## 5. AI Quality Dashboard

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P1

Executive-ready metrics that prove knowledge health.

| Metric | Example target | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Retrieval Accuracy | 95% | Recall@k on benchmark gold set |
| Chunk Health | 98% | Chunks meeting min length and metadata completeness |
| Duplicate Documents | 1.3% | Near-duplicate detection ratio |
| Coverage | 92% | Domain/hub coverage vs. configured taxonomy |
| Graph Density | 87% | Documents with ≥1 relationship edge |
| Embedding Freshness | 100% | Chunks with embeddings matching current model |

Built on existing audit pipeline (`make audit-distribution`, `make evaluate`) with continuous monitoring.

---

## 6. Knowledge Analytics

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P1

Actionable insights for knowledge managers.

- **Most searched documents** — popularity and retrieval frequency
- **Missing documentation** — taxonomy gaps with no assigned documents
- **Weak knowledge areas** — low graph density or poor retrieval scores
- **Broken links** — see_also / related targets that no longer exist
- **Duplicate chunks** — consolidation candidates

---

## 7. Multi-tenancy

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P2

Move from project-oriented to organization-scale deployment.

```
Organization
  └── Workspace          (team or business unit)
        └── Project      (product or initiative)
              └── Knowledge Base
```

- Tenant isolation at the knowledge-base boundary
- Shared platform services (search, analytics, connectors)
- Role-based access: admin, editor, viewer
- Per-tenant licensing and usage metering

---

## 8. Plugin System

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P2

Extensible architecture instead of hardcoded integrations.

### Plugin types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Source connectors** | GitHub, Notion, Google Drive |
| **Destinations** | Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector |
| **Transformers** | Custom chunking, metadata enrichment |
| **Custom connector** | REST API, SQL, filesystem |

```
Plugin SDK
  ├── register_connector(name, ingest_fn, sync_fn)
  ├── register_transform(name, transform_fn)
  └── register_export(name, export_fn)
```

---

## 9. AI Document Writer

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P2

Most RAG products ingest docs. Coltex will **generate** them.

```
Upload API spec / code / incident notes
              │
              ▼
Coltex automatically writes:
  ├── API Documentation
  ├── FAQ
  ├── Tutorial
  ├── Troubleshooting guide
  └── Runbook
              │
              ▼
  Ingest → Graph link → Embed → Search-ready
```

Output follows Coltex document types (22 typed classifications) and links into the existing graph.

---

## 10. Visual Knowledge Graph

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P1

GraphRAG today is internal plumbing. The visual graph makes it a **product feature**.

Example exploration path:

```
Authentication  →  JWT  →  Database  →  API  →  Services
     (click)        (click)   (click)    (click)   (click)
```

- Force-directed and hierarchical layouts
- Filter by edge type, hub, domain
- Click-to-open document in Coltex Console
- Export subgraph for presentations and audits

---

## Knowledge Intelligence Engine

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P0 · **Impact:** Heart of Coltex

Actively improves the knowledge base — not just indexes it.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Relationship discovery | Infer edges from semantic similarity and co-occurrence |
| Contradiction detection | Flag conflicting claims across related documents |
| Staleness detection | Age, sync lag, and deprecation markers |
| Duplicate detection | Near-duplicate documents and chunks |
| Merge recommendations | Propose canonical docs with diff preservation |
| Doc improvement suggestions | Gap analysis from taxonomy and search patterns |

Example flow: `API v2 → Deprecated → 18 dependent docs → suggest replacements → update graph → notify`

Details: [intelligence-engine.md](intelligence-engine.md)

---

## Knowledge Health

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P0

Operational insight dashboard — rare in RAG tooling.

| Metric | Example | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Knowledge Score | 94% | Composite health |
| Coverage | 98% | Taxonomy completeness |
| Duplicate Risk | 3% | Duplicate scanner |
| Outdated Docs | 12 | Staleness scanner |
| Broken References | 4 | Graph integrity validator |
| Graph Integrity | 96% | Orphan / dangling edge check |

Foundation today: `make audit-distribution`, `make evaluate`.

---

## AI Memory

**Status:** Partial (corpus tiers) · **Priority:** P1

Depth beyond a vector database:

```
Working Memory → Project Memory → Organization Memory → Long-term Knowledge → Archive
```

Corpus path: `knowledge-corpus/memory/`. Platform-unified memory services on roadmap.

---

## Event System

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P0

Event-driven architecture for scalable propagation:

`document.uploaded → chunk.created → metadata.updated → embedding.generated → graph.updated → search.updated → analytics.updated → health.rescored`

Manifest: [config/events.yaml](../../config/events.yaml)

---

## Knowledge Scheduler

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P1

Automated enterprise jobs:

- Nightly re-indexing
- Broken link detection
- Embedding refresh
- Duplicate scans
- Quality scoring
- Metadata cleanup
- Staleness and contradiction scans

Manifest: [config/scheduler.yaml](../../config/scheduler.yaml)

---

## Trust & Provenance

**Status:** Partial · **Priority:** P0

Every chunk should carry: original source, author, creation date, last update, confidence, version, license, verification status.

Available today: `PROVENANCE.md`, manifest checksums, distribution audit. Per-chunk provenance schema on roadmap.

---

## Reasoning Layer

**Status:** Partial (GraphRouter retrieval) · **Priority:** P0

Full pipeline: Question → Intent → Planner → Retriever → Re-ranking → Reasoning → Evidence Assembly → Answer.

Separates retrieval from response generation for trustworthy AI.

---

## Knowledge Lifecycle

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P1

Governed state machine: **Created → Reviewed → Verified → Published → Deprecated → Archived**

Manifest: [config/knowledge-lifecycle.yaml](../../config/knowledge-lifecycle.yaml)

---

## AI Governance

**Status:** Partial (audit, licensing) · **Priority:** P1

Enterprise controls: data retention, access policies, audit trails, compliance reports, version approvals.

Manifest: [config/governance.yaml](../../config/governance.yaml)

---

## Extensibility

**Status:** Planned · **Priority:** P0

Plugin types: source connectors, transformers, intelligence modules, reasoning modules, exporters, governance policies, UI extensions.

Hook points at every pipeline stage. SDK for registration without forking core.
